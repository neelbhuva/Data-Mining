To run the code on linux use command :

python3 filename.py 

or 

use ./bash.sh on linux machine



clean.py :

This code takes text file as input and outputs two files - train file and test file with necessary cleaning and insertion of start and end tokens. 

To use a smaller training set open the file and change variable N in main fuction which is the number of lines. For large dataset (blog - N = 899288 lines) the code will not complete execution on intel i5 8 GB RAM. A better machine is required.

ngram.py

This program will calculate n-gram probabilities, perplexity on test set, and also predict next word given a sentence. Preferred dataset and model should be entered by the user upon prompt from command line. To give a specific sentence (no OOV words) for prediction change variable test in main function.

visualize.py

This program helps with Exploratory data analysis. Change variable n to visualize bigram/trigram/fourgram/fivegram counts.
